  <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
  <p>Game Programming introduces students to concepts of computer game development, including scene modeling, physics engines, animation, character rigging, game AI, game UI, audio effects and networking.  The course will help students build the programming skills needed to turn ideas into games. Students will work on various game programming exercises with the Unity game engine and a final game development project. 
  <h2>Course Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>The course has the following prerequisites for junior and senior CS majors: *MATH 235 (C or better)* and *COMPSCI 220 (C or better)* and *COMPSCI 311 (C or better) or COMPSCI 250 (B+ or better)*.  MS/PhD students are assumed to have these equivalents from their undergraduate career. The course offers 3 credits. </p>

  <h2>Class plan</h2>
Lecture material will be pre-recorded and available asynchronousy. Course work can be done asychronouly. Students can join in-person or watch live lectures over zoom (attendance is optional). There will be  office hours with the instructor and the TAs remotely over zoom. Zoom links, lecture notes, recorded videos, programming resources, and assignments are posted on Moodle. Piazza will be used for asynchronous Q &amp; A with the instructor and TAs. Answers to questions on Piazza are expected within 1-3 workdays approximately.   No books are needed. 
<h2>Week-by-week outline (tentative)</h2>
  <p>Week 1: Introduction to Game Programming and Unity<br>
    Week 2: The Game Loop, Scene Modeling, C# scripting <em>(assignment 1 deadline)</em><br>
    Week 3: Introduction to Animation, Keyframing<br>
    Week 4: Character Animation and Rigging <em>(assignment 2 deadline)</em><br>
  Week 5: Animation Controllers, Game UIs<br>
  Week 6: Kinematics, Particle Effects <em>(assignment 3 deadline)</em><br>
  Week 7: Physics-based Animation, Numerical Integration <em>(project proposal deadline)</em><br>
  Week 8: Rigid Body Simulation, Collisions, Sound <em>(assignment 4 deadline)</em><br>
  Week 9: Procedural Content Generation<br>
  Week 10: Game AI: Planning, Pathfinding <em>(assignment 5 deadline)</em><br>
  Week 11: Game AI: Decision Making <br>
  Week 12: Game AI: Decision Making  (cont'd)&nbsp; (project checkpoint)<br>
    Week 13: Game Networking, Game Business and Ethics<em>&nbsp;</em><br>
   
    <br>
  </p>
  <h2>Expectations/Requirements</h2>
  <p>Students have to complete 5 programming assignments involving C# and Unity. Students have to also complete a final game project, with additional milestones, which are (a) project proposal, (b) progress checkpoint (where students meet with the instructor remotely to show progress and receive feedback), and (c) final project submission. Assignments and projects should be submitted by the designated deadlines -- 20% of the final mark is deducted for every day a submission is delayed and submissions are not accepted after 48h. Exceptions are allowed for medical reasons or due to accomodation services (see below). The amount of workload for assignments and projects varies depending on each student's background, skills, and workload from other courses -- yet a rough estimate is about a week to complete each assignment, and 3-4 weeks to complete the final project.

  Accommodation Statement</h2>
The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to providing an   equal educational opportunity for all students.&nbsp; If you have a   documented physical, psychological, or learning disability on file with   Disability Services (DS), you may be eligible for reasonable academic   accommodations to help you succeed in this course.&nbsp; If you have a   documented disability that requires an accommodation, please notify me   within the first two weeks of the semester so that we may make   appropriate arrangements.</p>
  <h2>Academic Honesty Statement</h2>
	Since the integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of   higher education requires honesty in scholarship and research, academic   honesty is required of all students at the University of Massachusetts   Amherst. &nbsp;Academic dishonesty is prohibited in all programs of the   University. &nbsp;Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to:   cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and facilitating dishonesty.   &nbsp;Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed   an act of academic dishonesty. &nbsp;Instructors should take reasonable steps   to address academic misconduct. &nbsp;Any person who has reason to believe   that a student has committed academic dishonesty should bring such   information to the attention of the appropriate course instructor as   soon as possible. &nbsp;Instances of academic dishonesty not related to a   specific course should be brought to the attention of the appropriate   department Head or Chair. &nbsp;Since students are expected to be familiar   with this policy and the commonly accepted standards of academic   integrity, ignorance of such standards is not normally sufficient   evidence of lack of intent (<a href="https://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct/acadhonesty/">https://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct/acadhonesty/</a>).<br>
	
  <h2>COVID policy</h2>
Students who are ill must not attend class in-person, and they will be offered reasonable accommodations for missed attendance. Students are also encouraged to wear masks during in-person classes.

  <h2>Equity and Inclusion Statement</h2>
 We are committed to fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion, where everyone is treated with dignity and respect. This course is for you, regardless of your age, background, citizenship, disability,  ethnicity, family status, gender identity, geographical origin, language, military experience, political views, race, religion, sexual orientation, or work experience. We bring different skills to the course and we will all be learning from and with each other.<br><br>

In both live and online settings we all are expected to uphold and promote a welcoming environment for learning. Politeness, kindness, and tolerance are expected at all times. Respect that people have differences of opinion, and work and approach problems differently. Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum and make sure that any criticism is constructive. Try and be aware of your own biases and avoid micro-aggressions. Listen to others and let them participate; ask yourself whether you dominating a conversation and not giving others a chance to contribute. Disruptive behavior is not welcome, and insulting, demeaning, or harassing anyone is unacceptable. We follow the university's guidelines for classroom civility. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.

Everyone has the right to be addressed by the name and pronouns that they use for themselves. Students can indicate their preferred/chosen first name and pronouns on SPIRE, which appear on class rosters. Please let the instructor/TAs know what name and pronouns they should use for you if they are not on the roster. A student's chosen name and pronouns are to be respected at all times in the classroom.

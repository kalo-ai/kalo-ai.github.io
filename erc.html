                      <p><strong style="font-style: normal; font-size: 16px;">Job Expectations &amp; Requirements</strong> <br>
All postdocs/MS/PhD/intern students are expected to engage in cutting-edge research in machine learning, vision, and graphics; develop and implement novel algorithms and techniques; collaborate with peers; participate in research meetings; communicate effectively in English; prepare presentations, video demos, and scholarly papers; and publish in top-tier venues, such as <em>CVPR/ICCV/ECCV, SIGGRAPH/SIGGRAPH ASIA/TOG, NIPS/ICML/ICLR</em>. Students will have access to state-of-the-art deep learning servers equipped with tens of GPUs, which will be bought under the grant. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 16px">Other Position Details</strong>&nbsp;<br>
  Candidates may specify in their application their preference over “in-person” or “remote” supervision options: <br>
  <strong> </strong><strong>(i) Remote Option: </strong>Postdocs and interns wishing to work remotely, or MS/PhD students who are attending a different program in a different university in Greece or another country, can apply for a remote supervision or co-supervision option. This option is also open for students participating in exchange and joint degree programs with the Technical University of Crete. Accepted candidates under this option will be employed under a direct contract. For remote supervision or co-supervision, the candidates need to first check whether this is allowed based on their current institution requirements. Co-supervision is possible provided that the candidate's current advisor agrees on such an option and a collaboration plan. Candidates should indicate in their application if they are interested in co-supervision. Accepted candidates, who will be residing outside Greece throughout their position's duration, will need to obtain tax residency certifications and translated tax treaty documents in English from their country of residence (after being accepted under the remote option). The remote supervision/co-supervision option is generally reserved for exceptional candidates demonstrating research excellence in their application, evidenced by first-author publications at top-tier vision, graphics, or ML venues. <br>
  <strong>(i) In-Person Option:</strong> Accepted MS/PhD/postdoc/intern candidates also have the option to reside in Greece during their employment. MS/PhD candidates will be enrolled at corresponding programs of the Technical University of Crete. For MS degree options, see <a href="https://www.mlds.tuc.gr/en/">here</a> or <a href="https://www.ece.tuc.gr/en/studies/graduate-studies/msc-in-electrical-and-computer-engineering-1">here</a>. For PhD, see <a href="https://www.ece.tuc.gr/en/studies/graduate-studies/phd-in-electrical-and-computer-engineering-1">here</a>. Detailed guidance about immigration procedures will be provided for accepted MS/PhD/postdoc/interns who wish to move and study in Greece.   <br>
  <br>
  The application deadline is <span style="color: #8C0003">February 16, 2025</span>.  Following a pre-selection and interview process, notifications are expected by mid March. For further inquiries or information, please contact "kalo[DOT]ai[DOT]lab[AT]gmail[DOT]com". </p>

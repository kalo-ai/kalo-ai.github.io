                            The Technical University of Crete hosts a new research project funded by the European Research Council (<a href="https://erc.europa.eu/news-events/news/erc-2023-consolidator-grants-results">ERC Consolidator Grant</a>), which aims to develop cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies for 3D data and interactive digital worlds. As part of the project, positions are available for students at the <strong>Master's (MS) and Doctoral (PhD)</strong> level. The research project titled <em>“<strong>NEURi3D – Learning to synthesize interactive 3D models</strong>”</em> aims to develop deep learning methods for the creation of interactive 3D models and scenes, as well as smart processing of 3D/4D scans and video. 
                            The scientific supervisor is <a href="https://kalo-ai.github.io/">Evangelos Kalogerakis</a>, and the project is implemented at the <a href="https://www.tuc.gr/en/home">Technical University of Crete</a>, in Chania.
